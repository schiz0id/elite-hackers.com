summary: I was a newbie once, too. It's not easy. With my years of hacking experience, I simply wanted to create a friendly resource which would allow intermediate programmers (ones who know HTML) to learn how to hack. Years of work and research are compiled into this one resource, and I'm proud of that.

## The Making ##
I wrote this page entirely in Windows Notepad, none of that uber-lame, pretty Frontpage crap. Everything you see here is raw-coded HTML written in the best editor. The images, however, were made in Adobe Photoshop 7.0.

### Schiz0id's Past ###
While growing up, I've always been into technology. I began playing video games a lot. Then one day in middle school, I was grounded from my xBox for failing my PE class. That's when I decided to learn how to hack. I spent countless hours learning how, then one day I hacked into my school's mainframe and changed my grade. I've been a 4.0 student since. Even in history.

### Special Thanks ###
I would like to thank my partner hacker, <a href="http://www.dividesbyzer0.com" target="_blank" title="dividesbyzer0">dividesbyzer0</a>, for providing me with some of the resources and training I needed to get this site where it is today. Dividesbyzer0 is without a doubt one of the most skilled hackers I have ever met. If you have to pick your enemies, don't pick him. He's a master at Visual Basic and Telnet.

I would also like to thank my fellow hacker parter, RaT, the founder of <a href="http://www.soldierx.com" target="_blank" title="SoldierX">SoldierX</a>. I spent over 2 weeks with RaT learning the art of cracking passwords. He helped me hack my very first database mainframe.

## Contact ##
PLEASE READ THE FAQ BEFORE E-MAILING ME! I hate it when I'm asked the same questions over and over again. There have been too many times where I have lost it and hacked people who don't bother reading the answer beforehand. Don't put yourself in this situation. You've been warned.

You can contact me anytime through my Hotmail account. I never sleep, so I will probably get back to you really fast. A true hacker is always quick on his feet.
