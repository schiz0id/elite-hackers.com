summary: I constantly get e-mails from people with a ton of good questions. This page contains the questions I get asked the most. If you have a question, look here first, because if you e-mail me a question that is already answered here, <strong>you will be hacked!</strong>

### Can you hack into my school and change my grades for me? ### 
No. I had to do it on my own for my failing PE grade, and it was really, really hard. Plus, I don't want to run the risk of getting caught. Read through my site, and these answers will come to you.

### Which programming language would you recommend? ### 
This depends on what you're trying to do. For writing viruses and whatnot, I prefer to use something advanced like QBasic or Visual Basic. If you're hacking a website however, learn ASP. Most sites on the internet use that because it is Microsoft, and it is the best. Unfortunately, ASP is a solid and secure platform, so you'll have to dig into it pretty deep to hack most websites running it.

### Where do you live? / What's your AIM? / Etc... ### 
The feds are always on the prowl for well-known hackers like me. You think I would give that information about myself away like that? If you need to contact me, do it via e-mail <a href="/contact">here</a>.

### What operating system do you recommend? ### 
I myself am using the newest version of Microsoft Windows, which is Vista. However, I wouldn't recommend it. Vista is relatively new as of now, and you have to know what you're doing in order to facilitate the power within it. I recommend using Windows XP for the beginners, since it's more familiar and stable.

### What type of computer do you have? ### 
I am currently running an Alienware. They look the coolest. How I paid for it is strictly confidential.

### How did you get to be the elite hacker you are today? ### 
Reading. And luckily for you, you have a lot of information right here in front of you that I didn't. I suggest that if you want to become as good of a hacker as I, that you read through this site.

### Can you build a website/hack a website for me? ### 
I really would love to, but I don't have the time between school and work. I just started my career at EB Games, and that takes up most of my spare time. Being 16 is quite a responsibility. Otherwise, I would.

### Why do you like Linkin Park so much? ### 
People who met me online know that I'm a Linkin Park fanatic. While this has nothing to do with hacking, Linkin Park is the only band that I can relate with, and their music is the only thing that can help me cope with my self-angst. Their superior music abilities with their singing and lyrics just make the perfect band for me.

### What is this Linux/UNIX thing all about? ### 
There is a reason that I don't cover Linux or UNIX in my writings. That being because NOBODY USES IT! Linux and Unix came along after Apple, which followed Windows. I have reason to believe that UNIX and Linux stole code from these two great OS's to produce what they have now -- which isn't much. Most of the time running Linux and UNIX is spent in what they call a shell, like DOS. This makes a hacker's job extremely boring and difficult. Stick to the original pros, Microsoft and Apple know what they are doing.
